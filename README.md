# Password-Generator
### generates/suggests a password with customization features

## Current:
1. generates a random 10-digit password with 5 numbers, 3 letters, and 2 symbols
2. allow user to custom number/letter/symbol/password length 
3. add user preference of custom words to add
4. saved password list (commented out)

## Future plans:
1. turn into website (made seperately with CodePen - can't figure out how to integrate Python with HTML/CSS, so I simply praticed my HTML/CSS skill seperately - I wanted to use HTML/CSS for review purposes and didn't want to learn Django or Web2py yet) 
2. turn into app (this will be done as practice when I have application developing knowledge - current progress: made a chatbox in Flutter/Dart with android studio virtual device by following youtube series)
