# Password-Generator
### generates a password - Working project

## Current:
1. generates a random 10-digit password with 5 numbers, 3 letters, and 2 symbols
2. allow user to custom number/letter/symbol/password length 
3. add user preference of custom words to add
4. saved password list (commented out)

## Future plans:
1. turn into website (stopped: can't figure out how to integrate python with HTML/CSS, so I simply praticed my HTML/CSS skill seperately - I wanted to use HTML/CSS for review purposes and didn't want dive too dip into Django or Web2py yet) 
2. turn into app
